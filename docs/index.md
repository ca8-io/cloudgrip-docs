# Welcome to CloudGrip Docs

## Build your business with a first class Cloud Management Platform solution

CloudGrip is a cloud management platform that
allows you to simplify and centrally manage your Azure Cloud. Itâ€™s a Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework in which you can fully define your Azure environment. Based on your preferred deployment tooling you can deploy resources to your Azure environment which is also maintained in code.

- :material-page-layout-header: CloudGrip is modular in its sense that it allows you to choose which features you want to utilize in the framework. You could go for only a setup that describes your Azure environment and automate deployments or you could add modules like RBAC-, Policy-, Costs management so you can extend your IaC config to match your complete Azure Environment.
- :material-page-layout-header: CloudGrip allows your organization or partners to write extensions for the framework. In that way organizations could even extend functionality to the framework to support single source of truth with regards to the Azure Cloud configuration. In the extension package you supply the parameters and properties and supporting pipelines. All within a single framework and codebase.
